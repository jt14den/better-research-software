## Software Setup

Before starting the course, make sure you have the following tools installed and working:

- [**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**](installation-instructions.html#step-1--install-visual-studio-code) — your main workspace and terminal  
- [**Git + Git Bash**](installation-instructions.html#step-2--install-git) — for version control and running commands  
- [**Python 3 (via uv)**](installation-instructions.html#step-5--install-python-using-uv) — for running and managing code  
- [**GitHub account**](installation-instructions.html#step-8--connect-to-github-simplified-setup) — for saving and sharing work  
- [**Spacewalks data and example code**](installation-instructions.html#step-6--download-course-files) — used in the exercises

These steps work on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.  
Windows users will use **Git Bash inside VS Code** instead of PowerShell.

## What’s New

### Updated authentication and environment setup

- **GitHub authentication is simpler** — sign in through your browser using **Git Credential Manager** (no SSH keys or tokens needed).  
- **Python installation uses uv**, a modern, fast installer that avoids manual setup.  
- **VS Code is your single workspace** — all setup steps run inside its built-in terminal.

## Get Started

Follow the step-by-step [**Installation Instructions**](installation-instructions.md)  
to install everything and verify your setup before the workshop.

If you’ve used older Git or Python workflows, note that these instructions reflect the **current recommended Carpentries practices** for reproducible, low-friction setup.
